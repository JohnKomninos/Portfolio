Technologies used:
Home page: On this page,I utilized one parent flex box that housed 4 smaller flex boxes. In the greeting section on the left, I used icons from https://ionic.io/ionicons/usage. On the right, I made the image a background in order to be able to better shape the image. Lastly, on the bottom, I used jQuery and JavaScript to create a cat carousel for the 5 cats I have.

AboutMe: Similar to the Home page, the AboutMe page also has one parent flex box that houses 3 smaller flex boxes. Upon opening this page, a modal pops up, instructing the user to click one of the 4 cards.  I used the modal exercise we did in class to structure how my modal functions here. In the middle portion, I used simple click handlers to be able to cycle between the cards. For the overview card, I made a click handler that hides the other cars completely and displays a new div.

Resume: The resume page is currently just a div place holder and will be updated once my new resume is constructed.

Projects: The projects page is also place holders until we have more projects completed. When loading this page the project place holders are hidden and by clicking the prompt in the middle of the page, the project place holders are loaded in.

RPG Game: on the RPG Game screen, I have one parent flex box that houses 4 children flex boxes. the 2 middle flex boxes make up the rpg game. the top flex box is for all text associated to the game and the bottom div contains all the buttons. As the user makes choices the text and button divs constantly get emptied and refilled. The game is currently programmed to be able to have the user select a class, and battle the first enemy. This game is not yet complete but I will continue to work on this game.

challenges faced:
1. centering list items in the nav section
2. structuring the overview so text would not overflow out of the div in the mobile view.
3. Overflow:scroll was working weird on mobile so I resized all parent flex boxes to fit the content on one page. This caused some issues with the gredient backgrounds.
4. Working with photos.
5. trying to adjust the opacity on a div without affecting the opacity of the text containted within the div.
